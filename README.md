# hello-world
Storage bin of knowlege 
I am originally from Atlanta, but spent most of my early childhood up north in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In 9th grade, I had the wonderful privilege of returning to Atlanta for good. Growing up I spent my years playing sports and learning what it takes to be successful. I am ambitious and have always done what it takes to make a name for myself. I am passionate about technology, mascots, DJing, and the Atlanta Falcons.
